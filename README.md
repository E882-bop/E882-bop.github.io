# E882-bop.github.io
This repostitry is a recreation of a website that once was avaliable for the world wide web, Untill being completely taken down by Mattel in 2020.

# Summary of Pingu Website

The pingu website was the official website for the now defunct company, HiT Entertainment and it's fictional character, "Pingu". The website consisted of plenty of activities for you to do on the website. (Ex: Games, Coloring, Ecards, etc...) The site was also avaliable from other places. (Ex: Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and France.)

# What the repositry is

This is an entire recreation of the pingu website during the year 2005. Some of the files for the other countries (Except the U.S.) have either been failed to be archived or were deleted from the website itself or Mattel.

# How it was archived

I used a source known as the "Wayback Machine" or "Internet Archive" to obtain these files. I used their service to try and find these files thorugh their archived sites.

# DISCLAIMER

You will need a internet browser that still supports the service "Adoble Flash", since this entire site has mostly .swf files in most (if not all) the pages, and that the Serivce ended support for modern applications since December 2020.
